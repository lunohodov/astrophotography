## Optimal Luminance to RGB ratios

This applies broadband targets such as reflection nebulae and star clusters.

- **For Limited Imaging Time (2-4 hours total)**: Use traditional LRGB ratios like 2:1:1:1 or 3:1:1:1.
    The efficiency advantage is real and significant when noise dominates the images.
- **For Moderate Imaging Time (4-8 hours total)**: Consider a balanced 1:1 ratio - equal time
    on luminance and RGB combined. Many experienced imagers now shoot 50% L and 50% color,
    such as 30 minutes total L and 10 minutes each of RGB LRGB imaging.
- **For Extended Imaging Sessions (8+ hours total)**: Consider pure RGB at 1:1:1 ratios.
    We can always create a synthetic luminance channel from RGB data during processing,
    giving us the best of both worlds.
- **Alternative "Super-Luminance" Approach**: Some imagers create an optimized super-luminance
    by integrating L, R, G, and B together, then use this combined with the RGB data LRGB imaging.
    This approach maximizes signal-to-noise while preserving color resolution.
